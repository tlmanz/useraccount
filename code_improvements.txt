# Changes and Improvements Made to the Original Code

I have significantly enhanced the original simple script by transforming it into a robust and modular application. Here are the key improvements:

## 1. Modular Architecture
- **Separated Concerns**: Split functionality into distinct modules (validation, API, logging, configuration)
- **Created Package Structure**: Organized code into a proper Python package structure

## 2. Validation Improvements
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Added validation for required fields
- **Email Validation**: Implemented dedicated email validation using the `email-validator` package
- **Normalized Emails**: Added email normalization for consistent data format
- **Single Responsibility**: Separated email validation into its own function
- **Validation Chain**: Created a foundation for a validation chain pattern

## 3. Error Handling & Logging
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added proper exception handling throughout the application
- **Structured Logging**: Implemented a comprehensive logging system instead of print statements

## 4. Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Added support for configuration via environment variables
- **Default Values**: Implemented fallbacks for missing configuration
- **Organized Settings**: Grouped settings logically by function (API, logging, directories)

## 5. API Communication
- **Retry Logic**: Added retry mechanism for API failures
- **Error Reporting**: Improved error reporting with detailed messages
- **Status Tracking**: Added tracking of success, errors, and skipped items

## 6. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite with mock objects
- **Test Coverage**: Tests for validation, API, configuration, and main functionality
- **Isolated Testing**: Used mocks to isolate components during testing
- **Improved Testability**: Made the code more testable by separating concerns

## 7. Code Quality
- **Type Hints**: Added type annotations for better code documentation
- **Docstrings**: Added comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Code Organization**: Improved structure with logical grouping of related functionality

## 8. User Experience
- **Summary Reports**: Added summary statistics of processed users
- **Graceful Termination**: Added handling for keyboard interrupts
- **Command Line Arguments**: Support for specifying input file via command line
